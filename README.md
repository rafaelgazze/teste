<h2> Nubank - Test </h2>

To run you need Python3 installed

```python --version```

Have one variable inside run.py to set INPUT application, not is better but :(

To run application install packages listed in requirements.txt:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

And run application:

```python run.py ```

To unit tests have pytest run:

```pytest ```
